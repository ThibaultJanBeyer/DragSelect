# Why?

Because apparently there was nothing that does not require jquery out there.  
This is better than https://jqueryui.com/selectable/ or https://jqueryui.com/draggable/ and has no dependencies.
We use it currently in a professional rich interface application where we have a file management system. The user can select files to organize them and change their metadata, with this plugin our users are able to select multiple files and perform batch/bulk-operations (applying changes to multiple files at once). We also started using it in production for a huge, graphical cloud hosting manager with a lot of active users. Users can select multiple servers, storages, etc. on an artboard to perform multi-operations, re-organize them, move them on the UI or batch-delete. Weâ€™re running it since January 18' itâ€™s super helpful and very stable, letâ€™s keep it that way. I can easily think of dozens other use-cases. Iâ€™m really keen to know how you use it in your projects, please let me know.

# Installation

Read the [Getting Started](http://dragselect.com/docs/intro).

## NPM
```console
npm install --save dragselect
```
## Yarn
```console
yarn add dragselect
```
## Global

Just [download the file](https://dragselect.com/v2/DragSelect.js) ([minified](https://dragselect.com/v2/ds.min.js)) and add it to your document:

```html
<script src="https://dragselect.com/v2/ds.min.js"></script>
```

> Note: if you are using `<script type=module` you can use the `DragSelect.es6m.js` or `ds.es6m.min.js` files as they include `export default DragSelect`

> We don't recommend the direct linking for production set-up since you'll not benefit from versioning. Please use `npm` if you can.
## Bower (deprecated)
```console
bower install --save dragselect
```

*Note: the Bower project is deprecated. Please use npm instead. If you have to use bower, you'll have to build the project after installing it via `npm run rollup`*

## That's it, you're ready to rock!  
Of course you can also just include the code within your code and bundle it to save a request.  

DragSelect supports `module.exports`, `AMD Modules` with `define`, `es6 modules` with `.es6m` versions and has a fallback to global namespace for maximum out of the box support.

# Usage
Now in your JavaScript you can simply pass elements to the function like so:

## Simple

Read the [Simple Usage Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/Simple)

The simplest possible usage.  
Choose which elements can be selected:

```javascript
new DragSelect({
  selectables: document.getElementsByClassName('selectable-nodes')
});
```

Find a live [example in the Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/Simple)

## Within a Scroll-Able Area

Read the [Area Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/Area)

Here the selection is constrained. You can only use the selection/drag inside of the area container:

```javascript
new DragSelect({
  selectables: document.getElementsByClassName('selectable-nodes'),
  area: document.getElementById('area')
});
```

Find a live [example in the Area Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/Area)

## With DropZones

Read the [DropZones Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/DropZones)

Example of DropZones. DropZones are areas where you can drop the selected elements into.

```javascript
const ds = new DragSelect({
  selectables: document.querySelectorAll('.selectable-nodes'),
  area: document.querySelector('#area'),
  dropZones: [
    { element: document.querySelector('#zone-1'), id: 'zone-1' }, // all selectables can be dropped into zone 1
    { element: document.querySelector('#zone-2'), id: 'zone-2', droppables: document.querySelectorAll('#item-2,#item-4') }, // only items 2 and 4 are droppable
  ],
  dropInsideThreshold: 1, // 1 = has to be 100% inside the dropzone, 0.5 = 50% inside, 0 = just touching is fine
});

ds.subscribe('callback', ({
  dropTarget: {
      id: "zone-1",
      element: <node />,
      droppables: [ <node />, â€¦ ],
      itemsDropped: [ <node />, â€¦ ], // elements that were selected on drop
      itemsInside: [ <node />, â€¦ ] // elements that are inside the bounds of the dropzone
  }) => {
  if(dropTarget?.itemsDropped?.length) {
    // do something
    console.log('Dropped', dropTarget.itemsDropped, 'into', dropTarget.id);
  }
})
```

This will also add some respective [classes](#classes)

Find a live [example in the guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/DropZones)

## Extended

All options are optional. You could also just initiate the Dragselect by `new DragSelect({});` without any option.  
Find all possible properties and methods in **[the docs](https://dragselect.com/docs/category/api)**  

```javascript
// if you add the function to a variable like this, you have access to all its functions
const ds = new DragSelect({
  // all settings are optional and can be added later
});

// this is how you add/update settings after initialization
ds.setSettings({
  // node/nodes that can be selected. By default will never add elements twice:
  selectables: document.querySelectorAll('.selectable-nodes'),
  // area in which you can drag. If not provided it will be the whole document & body/documentElement.
  area: document.getElementById('area'),
  // and many more, see "properties" section in the docs
})

// fired once the user releases the mouse. (items) = selected nodes:
ds.subscribe('callback', ({ items, event }) => {})
// returns all currently selected nodes:
ds.getSelection();
// Teardown/stop the whole functionality:
ds.stop();
// Reset the functionality after a teardown:
ds.start();

// and many more, see "methods" section in documentation
```  

> You can also use the "shift", "ctrl" or "command" key to make multiple independent selections.

## React

Read the [React Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/React)

## Mobile/Touch usage

Read the [Mobile Touch Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/Mobile-Touch)

## Accessibility (a11y)

**DragSelect is accessible by default**:  

> TLDR;  
> => Your `selectables` should be buttons: `<button type="button"></button>`.  
> => <kbd>ArrowKeys</kbd> are used for keyboard dragging.  

Read the [Accessibility Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/Accessibility)

## Use Your Own Drag & Drop

Read the [Custom Drag and Drop Guide](http://dragselect.com/docs/guided-examples/CustomDnD)

# Constructor Properties (Settings)

*DragSelect is hyper customizable*. Note, all properties are optional.

Read the [Settings API docs](http://dragselect.com/docs/API/Settings)

Moreover any setting can also be updated or added after the initialization, see [post-initialization setting updates](#post-initialization-setting-updates).

Here is the full list:  

| property | type | usage | default |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|area |single DOM element (node) |The square in which you are able to select |`document`
|selectables |DOM elements [nodes] |The elements that can be selected |`[]`
|autoScrollSpeed |number |The speed in which the area scrolls while selecting (if available). The unit is arbitrary (interval aims for 30fps). Set to `0.0001` to disable auto-scrolling. |`5`
|overflowTolerance |{ x:number, y:number } |Tolerance for autoScroll (how close one has to be near an edges for autoScroll to start) |`{x:25,y:25}`
|zoom |number |Zoom scale factor (in case of using CSS style transform: scale() which messes with real positions). Unit scale zoom. |`1`
|customStyles |boolean |If true, no styles will be automatically applied to the selector element (except position: absolute). |`false`
|multiSelectMode |boolean |Add newly selected elements to the selection instead of replacing them. |`false`
|multiSelectToggling |boolean |Whether or not to toggle already active elements while multi-selecting. |`true` (MacOS selection behavior)
|multiSelectKeys |array |Keys that allows switching to the multi-select mode (see the multiSelectMode option). Any key value is possible ([see MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)). Note that the best support is given for <kbd>Control</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Meta</kbd>. Provide an empty array `[]` if you want to turn off the functionality. |`['Control', 'Shift', 'Meta']`
|selector |single DOM element (node) |The square that will be used to draw the selection. | Auto-created HTML Element
|selectionThreshold |number |How much % of the element has to be selected to be considered selected (0 = just touching, 1 = fully inside the selection) |`0`
|draggability |boolean |When a user is dragging on an already selected element, the selection is dragged. |`true`
|immediateDrag |boolean |Whether a selectable element is draggable before being selected or needs to be selected first |`true`
|keyboardDrag |boolean |Whether or not the user can drag with the keyboard (Accessibility). |`true`
|dragKeys |{ up:string[], down:string[], left:string[], righ:string[] } |The keys available to drag element using the keyboard. Any key value is possible ([see MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)). |`{ up:['ArrowUp'], down: ['ArrowDown'], left: ['ArrowLeft'], righ: ['ArrowRight'] }`
|keyboardDragSpeed |number |The speed at which elements are dragged using the keyboard. In pixels per keyDown. |`10`
|useTransform |boolean |Whether to use the more performant hardware accelerated css transforms when dragging instead of the top/left positions. |`true`
|refreshMemoryRate |number |Refresh rate on memoization, higher numbers mean better performance but more lag if elements are moving, lower numbers mean less lag but worse performance. If none of your DOMNodes are moving, you can set it to a very high number to increase performance. Value in milliseconds. |`80`
|dropZones |[{ id: 'string', element: single DOM element (node), droppables?: DOM elements [nodes] }] |zones with association of droppable items that can be dropped into them. `id`: any unique identifying string. `element`: is the dropzone itself. `droppables`: the elements that can be dropped into that zone. This is optional, by default it is all selectables |`[]`
|dropInsideThreshold |number |How much % of the item has to be inside the dropzone to be considered inside (0 = barely touching, 1 = completely inside) |`1`
|dropTargetThreshold |number |How much % of the zone does the pointer has to be in to be considered a target (0 = anywhere in the zone, max: 0.5 = has to point at the center of the zone) |`0`
|usePointerEvents |boolean |Whether to use Pointer Events to replace traditional Mouse or Touch Events. Useful for tools like Google Blockly. |`false`
|selectedClass |string |The class name assigned to the selected items. |[see classes](#classes)
|hoverClass |string |The class name assigned to the mouse hovered items. |[see classes](#classes)
|selectorClass |string |The class name assigned to the square selector helper. |[see classes](#classes)
|selectableClass |string |The class name assigned to the elements that can be selected. |[see classes](#classes)
|selectorClass |string |The class assigned to the square selector helper |ds-selector
|selectorAreaClass |string |The class assigned to the square in which the selector resides. By default it's invisible |ds-selector-area
|droppedTargetClass |string |On an item corresponding the target dropzone. This is also the prefix for ds-dropped-target-${zone.id}. |ds-dropped-target & ds-dropped-target-${zone.id}
|droppedInsideClass |string |On an item that is within its dropzone bounds after a drop. This is also the prefix for ds-dropped-inside-${zone.id} |ds-dropped-inside & ds-dropped-inside-${zone.id}
|droppableClass |string |On element that can be dropped into at least one container. This is also the prefix for ds-droppable-${zone.id} |ds-droppable & ds-droppable-${zone.id}
|dropZoneClass |string |On each dropZone |ds-dropzone
|dropZoneReadyClass |string |On corresponding dropZone when element is dragged |ds-dropzone-ready
|dropZoneTargetClass |string |On dropZone that has elements from any successful target drop |ds-dropzone-target
|dropZoneInsideClass |string |On dropZone that has elements inside after any drop |ds-dropzone-inside

## Post-Initialization Setting-Updates

Any setting can be updated/added after initialization by using the `setSettings` method. Here is an example updating the `area` and the `selectables`:

```JavaScript
const ds = new DragSelect({})
ds.setSettings({
  selectables: document.getElementsByClassName('selectable-nodes'),
  area: document.getElementById('area')
})
```

# Event Callbacks

Read the [Events API docs](http://dragselect.com/docs/API/Events)

Event Callbacks are used like this:

```JavaScript
ds.subscribe('<event_name>', (callback_object) => {})
```

## Events

Read the [Events API docs](http://dragselect.com/docs/API/Events)

|event_name |callback_object |description |
|--- |--- |---
|callback |`{ items, event, isDragging, â€¦ }` |Fired after the selection (i.e. on mouse-up). 
|dragstart |`{ items, event, isDragging, isDraggingKeyboard, â€¦ }` |Fired when the selection starts (i.e. on mouse-down). 
|dragmove |`{ items, event, isDragging, isDraggingKeyboard, â€¦ }` |Fired when the mouse moves while dragging (i.e. on mouse-move).
|autoscroll |`{ items, isDragging, scroll_directions, scroll_multiplier, â€¦ }` |Fired when the area is auto-scrolled (i.e. cursor on a corner of the area).
|elementselect |`{ items, item, â€¦ }` |Fired when an element is added to the selection.
|elementunselect |`{ items, item, â€¦ }` |Fired when an element is removed from the selection.

> Note: all your callbacks subscribers will run happen after the internal code ran. If you want to run something before everything else, use the `pre` prefix. I.e. `predragstart` is an event that runs before any internal start logic.

### Callback Object Keys

Read the [Callback Object docs](http://dragselect.com/docs/API/Events#callback-object)

|callback_object_keys |type |description |
|--- |--- |---
|event |`MouseEvent\|TouchEvent\|KeyboardEvent` |The native HTML Event, depending on the situational context
|items |`Array.<HTMLElement\|SVGElement\|*>` |Current selected elements
|isDragging |`boolean` |If true, the user is dragging the selected elements, if false the user is drawing a selection
|isDraggingKeyboard |`boolean` |If true, the user is dragging the selected elements with the keyboard
|scroll_directions |`Array.<'top'\|'bottom'\|'left'\|'right'\|undefined>` |The direction in which the event is happening (i.e. scroll direction)
|scroll_multiplier |`number` |Speed
|item |`HTMLElement\|SVGElement\|*` |The single element currently being interacted with if any
|dropTarget |`{ id: 'id', element: node, droppables: [node], itemsDropped: [node], itemsInside: [node] }` |dropZone in which the droppable elements were dropped into. `itemsDropped`: all items that were dropped on the target. `itemsInside`: all items that are within the bounds of the zone |

> Note: all object keys are optional and might not be available, depending on the event type. So make sure to check for availability first
