# Mobile/Touch usage

**Congratulations, DragSelect can be used on a mobile by default ðŸŽ‰**

Keep in mind that using DragSelect on a mobile/touch device will also turn off the default scroll behavior (on `click` + `drag` interaction).

In 99% of the use-cases, this is what you want.

However, if DragSelect is only one part of a website, and you still want to be able to scroll the page on mobile, you can use an `area` [see settings](/docs/API/Settings). This way the default scroll behavior remains intact for the rest of the page.

For example like this:

```js
const ds = new DragSelect({
  selectables: document.querySelectorAll('.selectable'),
  area: document.querySelector('#area'),
});
```
