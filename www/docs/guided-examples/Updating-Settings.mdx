# Updating Settings

*DragSelect is hyper customizable*: all properties are optional, you can totally just pass an empty object and set the settings later.

## setSettings

Any setting can be updated/added after the initialization by using the `setSettings` method. Here is an example updating the `area` and the `selectables`:

```js
const ds = new DragSelect({})
// And set any settings at any point in time
ds.setSettings({
  selectables: document.getElementsByClassName('selectable-nodes'),
  area: document.getElementById('area')
})
```

See the [Settings](../API/Settings) page for a list of all possible options.
