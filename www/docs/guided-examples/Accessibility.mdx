# Accessibility (a11y)

**Congratulations, DragSelect is accessible by default ðŸŽ‰**

> TLDR;  
> => Your `selectables` should be buttons: `<button type="button"></button>`.  
> => <kbd>ArrowKeys</kbd> are used for keyboard dragging.  

Obviously, keyboard users wonâ€™t get the full visual experience but it works similarly to the OS default behavior.  

1. Selection: You can select items using the default select keys (usually space or enter) and also multi-select when using a modifier key at the same time. There is one little thing you have to do thoâ€™: the `selectables` have to be pressable (clickable)! To achieve this, they should be of type `<button type="button"></button>`.  

2. Drag: You can drag elements using the keyboard arrow keys, this will also scroll the area by default. You can press <kbd>Shift</kbd> in combination with an arrow i.e. <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>ArrowRight</kbd> to move the element 4x faster and also not scroll the area.

Try it out with your keyboard:
