# With DropZones

DropZones are areas where you can drop the selected elements into. 
- Set it up via [Settings](/docs/API/Settings#dropping).
- When dropped you’ll find a `dropTarget` in the [callback](/docs/API/Events#callback-object).
- You can also use some useful [methods](/docs/API/Methods#dropzones) related to DropZones.
- Using DropZones will also automatically add respective [classes](/docs/API/CSS-Classes#drop).

Here is an example:  

## The Setup

Setting up is easy, here is an example:
```js
const ds = new DragSelect({
  …
  // 1. Add DropZones settings
  dropZones: [
    // 2. By default all selectables can be dropped into a zone
    { element: document.querySelector('#zone-1'), id: 'zone-1' },
    // 3. However, if you want to restrict that, add the `droppables` key to the zone
    { element: document.querySelector('#zone-2'), id: 'zone-2', droppables: document.querySelectorAll('#item-2,#item-4') }, // here, only items 2 & 4 are droppable into zone 2
  ],
  // 4. There are also other customization you can do, for example:
  dropInsideThreshold: 1, // 1 = has to be 100% inside the dropzone, 0.5 = 50% inside, 0 = just touching is fine
});
```

Find all possible keys in the [DropZone Settings](/docs/API/Settings#dropping) section.

## The callback
Now you will see the `dropTarget` in the `callback`, which represents the topmost Zone that was targeted by the mouse on drag release. Here is an example on how you could use it:

```js
ds.subscribe('callback', ({
  // 4. If successfully drop by mouse, you’ll find a dropTarget key
  dropTarget: {
    // 5. It is an object with following keys
    id: "zone-1", // The ID of the zone
    element: <node />, // The DropZone element itself
    droppables: [ <node />, … ], // The elements that can potentially be dropped into that zone
    itemsDropped: [ <node />, … ], // elements that were selected when the mouse targeted the zone on drop
    itemsInside: [ <node />, … ] // elements that are actually inside the bounds of the dropzone
  }) => {
  
  // 6. We can check which items are dropped into the zone and do something
  if(dropTarget?.itemsDropped?.length) {
    console.log('Dropped', dropTarget.itemsDropped, 'into', dropTarget.id);
  }
})
```

Check out the [callback object API](/docs/API/Events#callback-object) for more information.

## The methods

You can also anytime use the [DropZone specific methods](/docs/API/Methods#dropzones) to get what you need. For example: 

```js
console.log('items dropped into zone-1', ds.getItemsDroppedByZoneId('zone-1'))
console.log('items inside zone-2', ds.getItemsInsideByZoneId('zone-1'))
```

Check out the [DropZone specific methods](/docs/API/Methods#dropzones) for more information.
