## Why?

Because apparently there was nothing that does not require jquery out there.  
This is better than https://jqueryui.com/selectable/ or https://jqueryui.com/draggable/ and has no dependencies.
We use it currently in a professional rich interface application where we have a file management system. The user can select files to organize them and change their metadata, with this plugin our users are able to select multiple files and perform batch/bulk-operations (applying changes to multiple files at once). We also use it in production for another huge, graphical cloud hosting manager with millions of active users. Users can select multiple servers, storages, etc. on an artboard to perform multi-operations, re-organize them, move them on the UI or batch-delete. We’re running it in production since January 18' it’s super helpful and very stable, let’s keep it that way. I can easily think of dozens other use-cases. We’re really keen to know how you use it in your projects, please let us know.
